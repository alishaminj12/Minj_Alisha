## Time Series Forecasting
### Methodology

### ARIMA Model
The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model serves as a foundational time series forecasting technique. This methodology involves a comprehensive analysis of historical data to discern underlying patterns and trends. The model parameters, denoted as order (p, d, q), are meticulously chosen by assessing the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions within the dataset.

### SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) Model
Building upon the ARIMA framework, the Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model introduces an additional layer to account for seasonality. The methodology encompasses the identification and incorporation of seasonal patterns inherent in the time series data. Parameters related to seasonal trends are integrated into the ARIMA model, enhancing its predictive accuracy.

### ETS Model
The ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality) model adopts a distinct approach by decomposing time series data into three key components: error, trend, and seasonality. Each component undergoes exponential smoothing to capture underlying patterns. The methodology entails determining the optimal level of smoothing for each component, providing a holistic view of the data's temporal dynamics.

### LSTM Model
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) represents a sophisticated recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture tailored for sequence prediction tasks. The LSTM model's methodology involves training a neural network with specialized memory cells capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. Its efficacy in time series forecasting, particularly for intricate patterns, positions it as a valuable tool in this context.
